* spacemacs-basic
** arrange layout
*** the reason using layout
    1. layout is good to organised your works when things get more and more.
    2. every layout has their own buffers, and that the logic level reason
*** the workflow
    1. The very Fist thing you need to do is : set layout with prefer name.
    2. for now, no need to get rid of the default layout.
    3. switch between smoothly, and focus on the main layout you're working on.
** project and navigation 
*** the reason using projet
    1. using git control your project is just easy, and spacemacs knows it's
       project when the version control is given.
    2. navigation is efficient when you have multiple projects to do.
    3. Always remember being smart to make your projects.
*** the workflow
    1. init projects with git.
    2. and navigation with keybindings
       | keybindings | what it do                             |
       |-------------+----------------------------------------|
       | ~SPC + p + l~ | list some projects you want to switch  |
       | SPC + p + f | find files in the focused projet       |
       | SPC + p + b | switch to buffer in the focused projet |
    3. using buffers
       - using helm to search buffers ( helm is everywhere, it changes how spacemacs work based 
         on helm search)
       - may the helm force be with you.
** code editing
*** require   
    1. lsp, snippets, flycheck, autocompletion
    2. be nicely coding and peacefully thinking and you will be good to go
*** workflow
    1. using vim and spacemacs coding style to do the most powerful thing ever.
    2. searching and replace , goto defination, fast scroll, quick jumping(SPC j j/i)
*** TODO Learning more and more about the Org-mod in spacemacs.  
*** test the lag and it's having lags which I will be dealing with later.
    ~the lag is gone when cost 71 RMB to get support for x410~
    
       
** remains to be solve
   1. Chinese support (or every language support)
   2. and learning how to grow with the spacemacs and happy hacking.
